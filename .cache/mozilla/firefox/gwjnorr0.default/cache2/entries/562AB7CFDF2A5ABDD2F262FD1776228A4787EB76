<h3>What is Easy Git (eg)?</h3>
<p>
In short, Easy GIT is a single-file wrapper script for <a
href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>, designed to make git easy to learn and
use.  (If you are not familiar with what git is, this page will make no
sense to you.)  In more detail:

<ul>
  <li>eg focuses on documentation and examples
    <ul>
      <li>Much of the work in eg is <a
          href="git-eg-differences.html#documentation">plugging a gap
          in git documentation</a>: providing simple tutorial-oriented
          command-specific built-in help.</li>
      <li>eg's documentation is example driven</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>eg removes obstacles to "getting" git
    <ul>
      <li> eg removes many principle-of-least-surprise violations that catch git newbies unaware</li>
      <li> eg provides subcommands that are a natural extension of capabilities users know from cvs/svn (eg also takes care to make sure the modifications to its subcommands are easily discoverable and error-avoiding for existing git users as well!)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>  
  <li>eg makes git easy to learn and use
    <ul>
      <li><em>easily learnable</em> - I claim you can learn git faster by
          first using eg than by starting with git directly</li>
      <li><em>interchangable</em> - You can switch between using eg and
          using git as often as you'd like.  I do it all the same on the
          same repositories.</li>
      <li><em>fully capable</em> - Unlike other wrappers for git, eg does
          not remove or limit any capabilities of git in order to simplify
          it; it just tries to layer concepts and present the capabilities
          in a more orderly fashion.</li>
      <li><em>compatible</em> - eg is essentially command-line backwards
          compatible to git; those familiar with git can start using eg by
          simply replacing "git" with "eg" in their commands.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>eg is biased towards luring existing <a
      href="git-for-svn-users.html">svn users</a>, due to the projects I
      work on and svn's large installed base</li>
</ul>

<!--
<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>
My purpose is to demonstrate that a version of git could be written that
achieves the following goals:
<ul>
  <li> <i>Easy</i>: I want it to be easy to use...and as easy for people to
       transition to from other VCSes, as switching from cvs to svn
       was. (Not seamless, but not difficult)</li>
  <li> <i>Capable</i>: I want it to be something that git lovers would still
       love to use.  Many suggestions to "fix" git's UI often curtail its
       power (<i>git add -p</i> is one of my favorite features and you
       better not take it away or make using it more difficult).</li>
  <li> <i>Friendly</i>: I want it to "feel friendly" to new users and
       converts from other systems, as well as to long time users.  A lot
       of things in git are beautiful from an architectural point of view
       once you understand all the internals, but much of git's UI
       just <i>feels</i> sharp and uninviting.  Perhaps I am just still
       missing some details of its internals or capabilities, but I don't
       believe that the sharpness is actually necessary.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Facilitating transition</h3>

<p>
I would really like to have a tool that
<ul>
  <li> SVN, bzr, or hg users can pick up and use almost immediately.</li>
  <li> git users can pick up and use almost immediately.</li>
</ul>
Some may scoff, but I think it is not farfetched.

<h3>Existing Git users</h3>

<p>
EasyGit is designed to make git easier to use and learn, not to extend
git's functionality.  Because of this, you won't find new capabilities
in EasyGit.  However, you don't need retraining either; eg is mostly
backward compatible with git, and any incompatibilities can be
discovered naturally and innocuosly during normal workflow (well,
except for the eg push default -- see below).  All you need to do is
replace 'git' with 'eg' in your commands.
</p>

<p>
The two biggest shockers for existing git users are the changes in
defaults to diff (which include both staged and unstaged changes by
default) and push (which pushes the current branch instead of matching
refs by default).  The latter is potentially problmatic, as it could
result in pushing changes the user didn't want.  However, the current
git default is equally bad for many new users.  The only safe thing
for both sets is probably to require users to specify what to push in
all cases; however, that seems pretty annoying for lots of very basic
setups.  I guess the push default of eg is my one big ugly
incompatibility with git.
</p>

<p>
Those curious about the precise differences between eg and git and the
rationale for these changes, can read my <a
href="git-eg-differences.html">verbose explanations</a>.
</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>
EasyGit's documentation is meant as built-in help; however, you can <a
href="documentation">view it online</a>.
</p>

<p>
There's also a (pdf) presentation, <a
href="presentations/git-introduction.pdf">An Introduction to (Easy)
Git</a> (more of a capability overview than a tutorial, though example
commands are shown).
</p>

<h3>Download/Install</h3>

<p>
Three easy steps:
<ul>
  <li>Install <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> >= 1.5.4 (eg is just a
      wrapper, which simply passes its arguments on to git except in
      specific important cases).</li>
  <li><a href="download">Download a copy of eg</a>
  <li>Place the eg script somewhere in your path</li>
</ul>
If you aren't one of those "shoot first and ask questions later" types,
just fire off an 'eg help' to get oriented.  You may also find the <a
href="git-for-svn-users.html">(easy) git for svn users</a> page helpful.
</p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>
You can follow <a href="http://gitorious.org/projects/eg">development of eg</a>
by cloning a copy.  Use either
<blockquote>
    git clone git://gitorious.org/eg/mainline.git eg
</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>
    eg clone git://gitorious.org/eg/mainline.git eg
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>Other similar projects</h3>

<p>
I feel that Easy Git is different from the others in the field in its
combination of goals (a) it focuses on trying to be easy to learn for
former cvs/svn users, (b) it tries to serve as a training tool for core git
rather than trying to replace core git entirely, (c) it tries to remain
backward compatible to core git (so that users already familiar with git
don't need any new training and to make it easier for core git to adopt
changes in eg), and (d) it's only a single file script to make it easier to
try out.
</p>

<p>
There are some other interesting alternatives out there that decided to
concentrate on different goals, including:
<ul>

  <li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/yap.git">yap</a> (<a href=
       "http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/95075"
       >announcement</a>), by Steven Walter
    <p>
      A porcelain that concentrates on making git easier for those
      interacting with subversion repositories; particularly trying to
      reduce the impedance mismatch that exists between the very
      different workflows typically used with native git repositories
      versus git-svn ones.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://pyrite.sophiasuchtig.com/">pyrite</a>, by Govind Salinas
    <p>
      A porcelain focusing on providing a Mercurial-like user interface.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/timj/2007/10/30/30102007-yummyyummysourcecontrol-version-09/">yyhelp</a>, by Tim Janik
    <p>
      A single file bash script serving as a minimal porcelain.  Emphasis
      on minimal; it's a very short file with no documentation that I could
      find.
    </p>
  <li><a href="http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2008/03/30/sourcecode-collaboration/">vng</a>, by Thomas Zander</li>
    <p>
      A porcelain focusing on providing a darcs-like user interface.
    </p>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Work in progress</h3>

<p>
Unfortunately, eg is not complete; it's just a preliminary version of a
work in progress.  For example, you may find it referring to help pages
that don't yet exist.  Sorry about that.  However, it is good enough for
daily use already...at least for me.  (Update: and for <a
href="http://log.ometer.com/2008-03.html">Havoc</a>).
